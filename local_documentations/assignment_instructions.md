✅ Module 3 Assignment

📜 Scenario

You have been hired as a web developer for a new gaming company named RevoFun looking to establish an online presence. Your task is to create a landing page that not only introduces the company but also provides access to various simple JavaScript games. This project is your chance to showcase your JavaScript skills while delivering an engaging user experience.

Audience: Your website is intended for casual gamers who want to enjoy simple yet entertaining browser-based games. The goal is to create a visually appealing and interactive platform where users can play games seamlessly.

Purpose:

* Showcase the Gaming Company: Introduce the fictional company with branding and an engaging design.
* Host Simple Games: Implement multiple JavaScript-based games that users can play directly on the site.
* Enhance User Experience: Design a fun and interactive experience with intuitive navigation and smooth gameplay.

📁 Requirements

You are required to develop a gaming company landing page that includes the following sections:

1. Home Page:
* A visually appealing introduction to the gaming company.
* A brief overview of the available games.
* Navigation menu with links to individual game pages.
1. Game Pages:
2. Each game must have a dedicated page with its own interactive JavaScript implementation. Choose at least three (3) out of five (5) game options:
* Number Guessing Game
* Concept:
  * The computer randomly selects a number (e.g., between 1-100).
  * The player tries to guess the number.
  * The game provides hints: “Too high” or “Too low.”
  * Limit the number of attempts (e.g., 5 tries).
* Rock, Paper, Scissors
* Concept:
  * The player chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
  * The computer randomly selects one as well.
  * The game determines the winner based on classic rules.
  * Optional: Keep track of scores.
* Clicker Game
* Concept:
  * A big button appears on the screen.
  * Every time the player clicks it, the score increases.
  * After a certain time limit, the game ends and displays the final score.
* Memory Card Game
* Concept:
  * A set of cards with hidden images appears on the screen.
  * The player flips two cards per turn.
  * If they match, the cards stay open; if not, they flip back.
  * The goal is to match all pairs.
* Avoid the Falling Objects
* Concept:
  * The player controls a small character at the bottom of the screen.
  * Random objects fall from the top.
  * The player must move left/right to avoid them.
  * The longer they survive, the higher the score.

Each game should include:

* Game instructions.
* Interactive gameplay using JavaScript.
* A "Back to Home" button.
1. (Optional) Leaderboard & User Profiles:
* Store high scores using localStorage.
* Allow users to enter a nickname before playing.

🚀 Deliverables

For this checkpoint, you are required to submit:

1. Deployed Website: A hosted version of your gaming company landing page (on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or similar platforms).
2. Source Code Repository: The complete codebase uploaded to GitHub, with well-structured files.
3. Project Documentation: A README file that includes:
  * Overview of the project
